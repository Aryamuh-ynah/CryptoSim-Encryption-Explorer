## 📘 Overview

**CryptoSim – Encryption Explorer** is an interactive, browser-based educational project that demonstrates how **classical cryptographic encryption techniques** work.

The goal of this project is to help users:

- Understand encryption fundamentals
- Learn how classical ciphers transform plaintext into ciphertext
- Experiment with encryption and decryption in real time

This project is especially suitable for:

- Cryptography beginners
- Cybersecurity students
- Academic demonstrations
- College / university mini-projects

This module allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using the Rail Fence (zig-zag) transposition technique. It includes:

- Input field for plaintext/ciphertext
- Rail count parameter
- Instant output generation
- Example panel for better understanding

---

![Vigenere Cipher Demo](https://github.com/Aryamuh-ynah/CryptoSim-Encryption-Explorer/blob/main/images/S3.png)

The Vigenère Cipher page demonstrates polyalphabetic encryption using a keyword/key. Users can:

- Provide input text and keyword
- Encrypt or decrypt instantly
- View output results and example guidance
```
